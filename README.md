# Proposal for QBOND
## 
The Qbond smart contract is implemented through the tokenization of staked positions. Each epoch issues tokens named MBNDXXX (XXX - epoch number), which represent staked position tokens. The maximum number of tokens in the Qubic network is 52, since rewards for staking in Qearn are distributed 52 weeks after the token is issued — at which point the token is burned. The core idea behind the Qbond smart contract lies in the tokenization of staking positions. This approach not only provides a better user experience (tokens are visible directly in the wallet) and easier trading, but also enables the creation of a DeFi ecosystem built upon these assets. For example, the announced Qloan smart contract will be able to use MBND tokens as collateral. At present, the MBND token is considered the most stable asset, as it offers a predictable yield by the end of its lifecycle — making it a perfect fit for use as collateral.
